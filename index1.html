          <p>Reducing Time Online â€“ Just like the heroin user needs to stop taking heroin, the internet addict needs to cut down on the amount of time spent online. In this sense, the goal of abstinence is the same. Some people prefer to stop using the internet cold turkey while others favour a more gradual reduction.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Treatment2">
          <p>Counselling â€“ Internet addicts undergo the same types of counselling utilised for alcoholism or drug addiction. The most effective form of counselling in this regard is known as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This therapy was originally developed to help people struggling with depression and other mental illnesses; it has proven rather successful as an addiction treatment as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Treatment3">
          <p>Group Support â€“ Internet addicts generally find group support to be very helpful. Group support provides mutual accountability, which is as important in internet addiction as in any other addiction. Group members rely on one another to hold them accountable and help carry them through the difficult times.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Treatment4">
          <p>Coping Strategies â€“ Developing coping strategies is critical to treating internet addicts. Unlike those recovering from alcohol or drugs, the internet is not a tangible thing that can simply be cut off. The internet is all around us, touching almost everything we do. Therefore, the recovering addict needs to learn coping strategies to be able to live in the digital world without returning to compulsive behaviour.</p>
